    Generate an approximately uniform set of spherical points using a Fibonacci lattice.

    This is a vectorized “Fibonacci sphere” sampler that places ``n`` points on a
    sphere using the golden-angle increment. The result is returned in spherical
    coordinates using the **colatitude** convention:

    - ``r`` is constant (set to ``radius``).
    - ``t`` (theta) is the colatitude from +z in ``[0, π]``.
    - ``p`` (phi) is the azimuth from +x toward +y in ``[0, 2π)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int, optional
        Number of sample points to generate.
    radius : float, optional
        Radius assigned to each generated point.
    randomize : bool, optional
        If True, apply a random phase offset to the golden-angle sequence to
        avoid always starting from the same meridian. This preserves the
        quasi-uniform spacing but changes the rotation of the point set.
    seed : int or None, optional
        RNG seed used only when ``randomize=True`` for reproducibility.

    Returns
    -------
    r, t, p : ndarray
        Arrays of shape ``(n,)`` containing spherical coordinates of each point.

    Notes
    -----
    - Internally, points are generated on a unit sphere and then assigned ``r=radius``.
      The returned ``t`` and ``p`` reflect the angular distribution of the lattice.
    - ``p`` is wrapped into ``[0, 2π)`` using modulo arithmetic.
    - This sampler is “approximately uniform” (low-discrepancy) rather than truly
      random; it is often preferred for deterministic coverage of the sphere.

    Determine the polarity of traced magnetic field lines based on their endpoints.

    This function classifies field lines into different polarity categories based on the
    radial position of their endpoints relative to two spherical boundaries. Optionally,
    if field lines are open (connecting inner to outer boundary), the sign of the Br field
    at the inner boundary is used to determine the polarity direction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inner_boundary : float
        The radial distance of the inner spherical boundary (e.g., 1 R_sun).
    outer_boundary : float
        The radial distance of the outer spherical boundary (e.g., 30 R_sun).
    br_filepath : PathType
        Path to an HDF file containing the Br (radial magnetic field) component data.
        This is used to determine the sign of open field lines.
    *traces : Traces or tuple of ndarray
        Either a single `Traces` object containing field line tracing results,
        or a tuple of two arrays `(start_points, end_points)` with shape (3, N),
        where N is the number of field lines.
    **kwargs : dict
        Additional keyword arguments passed to `np.isclose()` for numerical comparison
        of endpoint radii with the inner/outer boundaries (e.g., `atol=1e-2`).

    Returns
    -------
    polarity : ndarray of Polarity
        An array of integer enum values representing the polarity of each field line:

            - `Polarity.R0_R1_POS`: Open field line from inner to outer boundary with positive Br.
            - `Polarity.R0_R1_NEG`: Open field line from inner to outer boundary with negative Br.
            - `Polarity.R0_R0`: Closed field line that begins and ends on the inner boundary.
            - `Polarity.R1_R1`: Disconnected field line (begins and ends on the outer boundary).
            - `Polarity.ERROR`: Field line does not reach one or both of the inner/outer boundaries.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the number or type of arguments in `traces` is invalid.
    ImportError
        If the optional :py:mod:`scipy` library is not installed, which is required for

    Notes
    -----
    - This function assumes that the :attr:`br_filepath` contains the radial magnetic field component.
